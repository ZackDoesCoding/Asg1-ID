Z-Studios GameDev Website

    Z-Studios Interactive Portfolio Website

My website Z-Studios is a fully functioning website that showcases my interactive design, multimedia and game development work via a fully responsive format. The goal was to create a clean modern dark interface while providing maximum usability and a professional presentation of my work.
The project focuses on providing intuitive navigation for users to find accessible content in a structured manner with visual elements that align with my personal brand.

The website is a platform for potential employers, business partners and/or instructors to view my creative works, capabilities and direction. It will provide a strong first impression by utilizing a professional UI, thoughtful layout and structured project presentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Design Process

The design process followed a user-centred approach, focusing on understanding the needs of the site’s three primary user groups:

Recruiters looking for clear, quickly accessible project samples.
Viewers looking for intuitive navagition and a user friendly experience.
Collaborators assessing my skillset and creative style.

A series of wireframes and mockups were created for both desktop and mobile to ensure consistency and responsiveness.

    User Stories

As a recruiter, I want to view projects quickly so I can assess the creator’s skills.
As a collaborator, I want to see organized and visually compelling work so I can work effectively.
As a mobile user, I want a responsive layout so I can browse without zooming or scrolling sideways.
As a viewer, I want intuitive navigation so I can move through sections without confusion.
